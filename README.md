## Can i run it?

Well, if you have an Android device yes! If you have an iOS device, also yes but no.

This project is a Flutter application, you can find the apk builds on `/dist` folder, they're separated for all ABIs flutter can compile (if you don't know what is an ABI or which ABI you device have, just download the `android-all-0.0.1.apk` file). iOS builds will not be provided as it requires an Apple's Developer Program membership that costs a fuckton of money, but if you have one of these you can simply install flutter, run `flutter pub get` and `flutter build ios`.
